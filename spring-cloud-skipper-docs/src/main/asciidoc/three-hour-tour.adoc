[[three-hour-tour]]
= Using Skipper

This section is the "'three-hour tour'" of Skipper.
It describes how to configure and use the main feature set of Skipper in detail.
We will cover the shell, platforms, packages, and repositories.

Feel free to reach out on https://gitter.im/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-skipper[Gitter] for help and ask questions on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spring-cloud-skipper[Stack Overflow].
Issues can be filed on https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-skipper/issues[Github issues].

[[using-shell]]
== Skipper Shell

The shell is based on the https://projects.spring.io/spring-shell/[Spring Shell project].
Two of the shell's best features are tab-completion and colorization of commands.
Use the 'help' command or the `--help` argument when starting the shell to get help information.
The output of using the `--help` argument follows:

[source,bash,options=nowrap]
----
Skipper Options:

  --spring.cloud.skipper.client.serverUri=<uri>                        Address of the Skipper Server [default: http://localhost:7577].
  --spring.cloud.skipper.client.username=<USER>                        Username of the Skipper Server [no default].
  --spring.cloud.skipper.client.password=<PASSWORD>                    Password of the Skipper Server [no default].
  --spring.cloud.skipper.client.credentials-provider-command=<COMMAND> Executes an external command which must return an OAuth Access Token [no default].
  --spring.cloud.skipper.client.skip-ssl-validation=<true|false>       Accept any SSL certificate (even self-signed) [default: no].

  --spring.shell.historySize=<SIZE>                 Default size of the shell log file [default: 3000].
  --spring.shell.commandFile=<FILE>                 Skipper Shell executes commands read from the file(s) and then exits.

  --help                                            This message.
----

=== Shell Modes

The shell can be started in either interactive or non-interactive mode.
In the case of the non-interactive mode, command line arguments are executed as Skipper commands, and then the shell exits.
If there are any arguments that do not have the prefix `spring.cloud.skipper.client`, they are considered as skipper commands to execute.


Consider the following example:

[source,bash,subs=attributes]
```
java -jar spring-cloud-skipper-shell-{project-version}.jar --spring.cloud.skipper.client.serverUri=http://localhost:9123/api
```
The preceding example brings up the interactive shell and connects to `http://localhost:9123/api`.
Now consider the following command:

[source,bash,subs=attributes]
```
$ java -jar spring-cloud-skipper-shell-{project-version}.jar --spring.cloud.skipper.client.serverUri=http://localhost:9123/api search
```

The preceding command connects to `http://localhost:9123/api`, executes the `search` command, and then exits.

A more common use case would be to update a package from within a CI job -- for example, in a Jenkins Stage, as shown in the following example:

[source,groovy]
```
stage ('Build') {
    steps {
        checkout([
            $class: 'GitSCM',
            branches: [
                [name: "*/master"]
            ],
            userRemoteConfigs: [
                [url: "https://github.com/markpollack/skipper-samples.git"]
            ]
        ])
        sh '''
            VERSION="1.0.0.M1-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)-VERSION"
            mvn org.codehaus.mojo:versions-maven-plugin:2.3:set -DnewVersion="${VERSION}"
            mvn install
            java -jar /home/mpollack/software/skipper.jar upgrade --package-name helloworld --release-name helloworld-jenkins --properties version=${VERSION}
        '''
    }
}
```


[[using-platforms]]
== Platforms

Skipper supports deploying to multiple platforms.
The platforms included are Local, Cloud Foundry, and Kubernetes.
For each platform, you can configure multiple accounts.
Each `account name` must be globally unique across all platforms.

Usually, different `accounts` correspond to different orgs or spaces for Cloud Foundry and to different namespaces for a single Kubernetes cluster.

Platforms are defined by using Spring Boot's https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html[Externalized Configuration] feature.
To simplify the getting started experience, if a local platform account is not defined in your configuration, Skipper creates a `local` deployer implementation named `default`.

You can make use of the https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-config/1.3.3.RELEASE/multi/multi__spring_cloud_config_server.html#_encryption_and_decryption[Encryption and Decryption] features of Spring Cloud Config as one way to secure credentials.

Distinct from where Skipper deploys the application, you can also run the Skipper server itself on a platform.
Installation on other platforms is covered in the <<skipper-installation>> section.

The following example YAML file shows configuration of all three platforms:

----
spring:
  cloud:
    skipper:
      server:
        platform:
          local:
            accounts:
              localDevDebug:
                javaOpts: "-Xdebug"
          cloudfoundry:
            accounts:
              cf-dev:
                connection:
                  url: https://api.run.pivotal.io
                  org: scdf-ci
                  space: space-mark
                  domain: cfapps.io
                  username: <your-username>
                  password: <your-password>
                  skipSslValidation: false
                deployment:
                  deleteRoutes: false
          kubernetes:
            accounts:
              minikube:
                namespace: default
----

The properties available for each platform can be found in the following classes:

* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-local/blob/master/spring-cloud-deployer-local/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/deployer/spi/local/LocalDeployerProperties.java[LocalDeployerProperties].
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-cloudfoundry/blob/master/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/deployer/spi/cloudfoundry/CloudFoundryDeploymentProperties.java[CloudFoundryDeploymentProperties] for `deployment:` and https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-cloudfoundry/blob/master/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/deployer/spi/cloudfoundry/CloudFoundryConnectionProperties.java[CloudFoundryConnectionProperties] for the `connection:`.
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-kubernetes/blob/master/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/deployer/spi/kubernetes/KubernetesDeployerProperties.java[KubernetesDeployerProperties]

[[using-packages]]
== Packages

Packages contain all the necessary information to install your application or group of applications.
The approach to describing the applications is to use a YAML file that provides all the necessary information to help
facilitate searching for your application hosted in a Package Registry and to install your application to a
platform.

To make it easy to customize a package, the YAML files are templated.
The final version of the YAML file, with all values substituted, is known as the release `manifest`.
Skipper currently understands how to deploy applications based off a YAML file that contains the information needed for
a _Spring Cloud Deployer_ or _Cloud Foundry_ implementation to deploy an application.
It describes where to find the application (an HTTP, Maven or Docker location), application properties (think Spring
Boot `@ConfigurationProperties`), and deployment properties (such as how much memory to use).

[[using-package-format]]
=== Package Format

A package is a collection of YAML files that are zipped up into a file with the following naming convention:
`[PackageName]-[PackageVersion].zip` (for example: `mypackage-1.0.0.zip`).

A package can define a single application or a group of applications.

==== Single Application

The single application package file, `mypackage-1.0.0.zip`, when unzipped, should have the following directory
structure:

[source,text]
----
mypackage-1.0.0
├── package.yml
├── templates
│   └── template.yml
└── values.yml
----

The `package.yml` file contains metadata about the package and is used to support Skipper's search functionality.
The `template.yml` file contains placeholders for values that are specified in the `values.yml` file.
When installing a package, placeholder values can also be specified, and they would override the values in the
`values.yml` file.
The templating engine that Skipper uses is https://github.com/samskivert/jmustache[JMustache].
The YAML files can have either `.yml` or `.yaml` extensions.

The  https://github.com/markpollack/skipper-sample-repository/blob/master/src/main/resources/static/repository/experimental/helloworld/helloworld-1.0.0.zip[helloworld-1.0.0.zip] or https://github.com/markpollack/skipper-sample-repository/blob/master/src/main/resources/static/repository/experimental/helloworld-docker/helloworld-docker-1.0.0.zip[helloworld-docker-1.0.0.zip] files are good examples to use as a basis to create your own package "'by hand'".

The source code for the `helloworld` sample can be found https://github.com/markpollack/skipper-samples[here].

[[using-package-format-multiple-apps]]
==== Multiple Applications

A package can contain a group of applications bundled in it.
In those cases, the structure of the package would resemble the following:

[source,text]
----
mypackagegroup-1.0.0
├── package.yml
├── packages
│   ├── app1
│   │   ├── package.yml
│   │   ├── templates
│   │   │   └── log.yml
│   │   └── values.yml
│   └── app2
│       ├── package.yml
│       ├── templates
│       │   └── time.yml
│       └── values.yml
└── values.yml
----

In the preceding example, the `mypackagegroup` still has its own `package.yml` and `values.yml` to specify the package
metadata and the values to override. All the applications inside the `mypackagegroup`  are considered to be
sub-packages and follow a package structure similar to the individual packages. These sub packages need to be specified
inside the `packages` directory of the root package, `mypackagegroup`.

The  https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-skipper/blob/master/spring-cloud-skipper-server-core/src/test/resources/repositories/binaries/test/ticktock/ticktock-1.0.0.zip[ticktock-1.0.0.zip]
file is a good example to use as a basis for creating your own package 'by-hand'.
 
[NOTE]
====
Packages with template kind _CloudFoundryApplication_ currently doesn't support multiple applications format.
====

[[using-package-metadata]]
=== Package Metadata

The `package.yml` file specifies the package metadata.
A sample package metadata would resemble the following:

----
# Required Fields
apiVersion: skipper.spring.io/v1
kind: SkipperPackageMetadata
name: mypackage
version: 1.0.0

# Optional Fields
packageSourceUrl: https://github.com/some-mypackage-project/v1.0.0.RELEASE
packageHomeUrl: http://some-mypackage-project/
tags: skipper, mypackage, sample
maintainer: https://github.com/maintainer
description: This is a mypackage sample.
----

*Required Fields:*

* `apiVersion`: The Package Index spec version this file is based on.
* `kinds`: What type of package system is being used.
* `name`: The name of the package.
* `version`: The version of the package.

[NOTE]
====
Currently only supported _kind_ is *SkipperPackageMetadata*.
====

*Optional Fields:*

* `packageSourceUrl`: The location of the source code for this package.
* `packageHomeUrl`: The home page of the package.
* `tags`:  A comma-separated list of tags to be used for searching.
* `maintainer`: Who maintains this package.
* `description`: Free-form text describing the functionality of the package -- generally shown in search results.
* `sha256`: The hash of the package binary (not yet enforced).
* `iconUrl`: The URL for an icon to show for this package.
* `origin`: Free-form text describing the origin of this package -- for example, your company name.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, the package search functionality is only a wildcard match against the name of the package.
====

A Package Repository exposes an `index.yml` file that contains multiple metadata documents and that uses the standard three dash notation `---` to separate the documents -- for example, https://skipper-repository.cfapps.io/repository/experimental/index.yml[index.yml].

[[package-templates]]
=== Package Templates
Currently, two type of applications are supported. One having `SpringCloudDeployerApplication` kind, which means the
applications can be deployed into the target platforms only by using their corresponding Spring Cloud Deployer
implementations (CF, Kubernetes Deployer, and so on). Other is having `CloudFoundryApplication` kind, which means the
applications are directly deployed into _Cloud Foundry_ using its manifest support.

[[package-templates-scdep]]
==== Spring Cloud Deployer 

The `template.yml` file has a package structure similar to that of the following example:

[source,text]
----
mypackage-1.0.0
├── package.yml
├── templates
│   └── template.yml
└── values.yml
----

[NOTE]
====
Actual template file name doesn't matter and you can have multiple template files. These just need to be inside of a
`templates` directory.
====

[source,yaml]
----
# template.yml
apiVersion: skipper.spring.io/v1
kind: SpringCloudDeployerApplication
metadata:
  name: mypackage
  type: sample
spec:
  resource: maven://org.mysample:mypackage
  resourceMetadata:  maven://org.mysample:mypackage:jar:metadata:{{spec.version}}
  version: {{spec.version}}
  applicationProperties:
    {{#spec.applicationProperties.entrySet}}
    {{key}}: {{value}}
    {{/spec.applicationProperties.entrySet}}
  deploymentProperties:
    {{#spec.deploymentProperties.entrySet}}
    {{key}}: {{value}}
    {{/spec.deploymentProperties.entrySet}}
----

The `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `spec.resource` are required.

The `spec.resource` and `spec.version` define where the application executable is located. The `spec.resourceMetadata`
field defines where a https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/configuration-metadata.html[Spring Boot Configuration metadata]
jar is located that contains the configuration properties of the application. This is either a Spring Boot uber jar
hosted under a HTTP endpoint or a Maven or Docker repository. The template placeholder `{{spec.version}}` exists so that
the version of a specific application can be easily upgraded without having to create a new package .zip file.

The `resource` is based on `http://` or `maven://` or `docker:`. The format for specifying a `resource` follows documented
types in <<package-templates-resources>>.


[[package-templates-cf]]
==== Cloud Foundry
The `template.yml` file has a package structure similar to that of the following example:

[source,text]
----
mypackage-1.0.0
├── package.yml
├── templates
│   └── template.yml
└── values.yml
----

`template.yml` commonly has content similar to the following:

[NOTE]
====
Actual template file name doesn't matter and you can have multiple template files. These just need to be inside of a
`templates` directory.
====

[source,yaml]
----
# template.yml
apiVersion: skipper.spring.io/v1
kind: CloudFoundryApplication
spec:
  resource: maven://org.mysample:mypackage
  version: {{spec.version}}
  manifest:
    {{#spec.manifest.entrySet}}
    {{key}}: {{value}}
    {{/spec.manifest.entrySet}}
----

Where values could for example be something like:

[source,yaml]
----
# values.yml
spec:
  version: 1.0.0
  manifest:
    memory: 1024
    disk-quota: 1024
----

Possible values of a `spec.manifest` are:

[cols="10,10,15"]
|===
| Key | Value | Notes

| `buildpack`
| (String)
| _buildpack_ attribute as is.

| `command`
| (String)
| _command_ attribute as is.

| `memory`
| (String or Integer)
| _memory_ attribute as is if type is Integer, String is converted using same format in a CF, like `1024M` or `2G`. `1024` and `1024M` are equivalent. 

| `disk-quota`
| (String or Integer)
| _disk_quota_ attribute as is if type is Integer, String is converted using same format in a CF, like `1024M` or `2G`. `1024` and `1024M` are equivalent. 

| `timeout`
| (Integer)
| _timeout_ attribute as is.

| `instances`
| (Integer)
| _instances_ attribute as is.

| `no-hostname`
| (Boolean)
| _no-hostname_ attribute as is.

| `no-route`
| (Boolean)
| _no-route_ attribute as is.

| `random-route`
| (Boolean)
| _random-route_ attribute as is.

| `health-check-type`
| (String) 
| _health-check-type_ having possible values of `port`, `process` or `http`.

| `health-check-http-endpoint`
| (String)
| _health-check-http-endpoint_ attribute as is.

| `stack`
| (String)
| _stack_ attribute as is.

| `services`
| (List<String>)
| _services_ attribute as is.

| `domains`
| (List<String>)
| _domains_ attribute as is.

| `hosts`
| (List<String>)
| _hosts_ attribute as is.

| `env`
| (Map<String,Object>)
| _env_ attribute as is.
|===

[NOTE]
====
Remember that when a value is given from a command-line, replacement happens as is defined in a template. Using a template
format `{{#spec.manifest.entrySet}}` shown above, _List_ would be given in format `spec.manifest.services=[service1, service2]`
and _Map_ would be given in format `spec.manifest.env={key1: value1, key2: value2}`.
====

The `resource` is based on `http://` or `maven://` or `docker:`. The format for specifying a `resource` follows documented
types in <<package-templates-resources>>.

[[package-templates-resources]]
==== Resources
This section contains resource types currently supported.

===== HTTP Resources

The following example shows a typical spec for HTTP:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  resource: https://example.com/app/hello-world
  version: 1.0.0.RELEASE
----

There is a naming convention that must be followed for HTTP-based resources so that Skipper can assemble a full URL from the `resource` and `version` field and also parse the version number given the URL.
The preceding `spec` references a URL at `https://example.com/app/hello-world-1.0.0.RELEASE.jar`.
The `resource` and `version` fields should not have any numbers after the `-` character.

===== Docker Resources

The following example shows a typical spec for Docker:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  resource: docker:springcloud/spring-cloud-skipper-samples-helloworld
  version: 1.0.0.RELEASE
----

The mapping to docker registry names follows:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  resource: docker:<user>/<repo>
  version: <tag>
----

===== Maven Resources

The following example shows a typical spec for Maven:

----
spec:
  resource: maven://org.springframework.cloud.samples:spring-cloud-skipper-samples-helloworld:1.0.0.RELEASE
  version: 1.0.0.RELEASE
----

The mapping to Maven artifact names follows

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  resource: maven://<maven-group-name>:<maven-artifact-name>
  version:<maven-version>
----

There is only one setting to specify with Maven repositories to search.
This setting applies across all platform accounts.
By default, the following configuration is used:

[source,yaml]
----
maven:
  remoteRepositories:
    springRepo: https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot
----

You can specify other entries and also specify proxy properties.
This is currently best documented https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/1.3.0.M2/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-maven-configuration[here].
Essentially, this needs to be set as a property in your launch properties or `manifest.yml` (when pushing to PCF), as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
# manifest.yml
...
env:
    MAVEN_REMOTE_REPOSITORIES_{{REPOSITORY_NAME}}_URL: https://repo.spring.io
...
----

The metadata section is used to help search for applications after they have been installed.
This feature will be made available in a future release.

The `spec` contains the resource specification and the properties for the package.

The `resource` represents the resource URI to download the application from.
This would typically be a Maven co-ordinate or a Docker image URL.

The `SpringCloudDeployerApplication` kind of application can have `applicationProperties` and `deploymentProperties`
as the configuration properties.

The application properties correspond to the properties for the application itself.

The deployment properties correspond to the properties for the deployment operation performed by Spring Cloud Deployer
implementations.

[NOTE]
====
The `name` of the template file can be anything, as all the files under `templates` directory are loaded to apply the
template configurations.
====

[[using-package-values]]
=== Package Values

The `values.yml` file contains the default values for any of the keys specified in the template files.

For instance, in a package that defines one application, the format is as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
version: 1.0.0.RELEASE
spec:
  applicationProperties:
    server.port: 9090
----

If the package defines multiple applications, provide the name of the package in the top-level YML section to scope the
`spec` section. Consider the example of a multiple application package with the following layout:

[source,text]
----
ticktock-1.0.0/
├── packages
│   ├── log
│   │   ├── package.yml
│   │   └── values.yml
│   └── time
│       ├── package.yml
│       └── values.yml
├── package.yml
└── values.yml

----
The top-level `values.yml` file might resemble the following:

[source,yaml]
----
#values.yml

hello: world

time:
  appVersion: 1.3.0.M1
  deployment:
    applicationProperties:
      log.level: WARN
      trigger.fixed-delay: 1
log:
  deployment:
    count: 2
    applicationProperties:
      log.level: WARN
      log.name: skipperlogger
----

The preceding `values.yml` file sets `hello` as a variable available to be used as a placeholder in the
`packages\log\values.yml` file and the `packages\time\values.yml`. However, the YML section under `time:` is applied
only to the `packages\time\values.yml` file and the YML section under `log:` is applied only to the
`packages\log\values.yml` file.

[[using-package-upload]]
=== Package Upload

After creating the package in the structure shown in the previous section, we can compress it in a zip file with the following naming scheme:
[PackageName]-[PackageVersion].zip (for example, mypackage-1.0.0.zip).

For instance, the package directory would resemble the following before compression:

----
mypackage-1.0.0
├── package.yml
├── templates
│   └── template.yml
└── values.yml
----
The zip file can be uploaded into one of the local repositories of the Skipper server.
By default, the Skipper server has a local repository with the name, `local`.

By using the Skipper shell, we can upload the package zip file into the Skipper server's local repository, as follows:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
skipper:>package upload --path /path-to-package/mypackage-1.0.0.zip
Package uploaded successfully:[mypackage:1.0.0]
----

If no `--repo-name` is set, the `upload` command uses `local` as the repository to upload.

We can then use the `package list` or `package search` command to see that our package has been uploaded, as shown (with its output) in the following example:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
skipper:>package list
╔═════════════════╤═══════╤════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║      Name       │Version│                                  Description                                   ║

[[using-package-create]]
=== Creating Your Own Package

In this section, we create a package that can be deployed by using Spring Cloud Deployer implementations.

For this package, we are going to create a simple package and upload it to our local machine.

To get started creating your own package, create a folder following a naming convention of `[package-name]-[package-version]`. In our case, the folder name is `demo-1.0.0`.
In this directory, create empty files named `values.yml` and `package.yml` and create a `templates` directory.
In the `templates` directory, create an empty file named `template.yml`.

Go into the `package.yml` where we are going to specify the package metadata. For this app, we fill only the minimum values possible, as shown in the following example:

----
# package.yml

apiVersion: skipper.spring.io/v1
kind: SkipperPackageMetadata
name: demo
version: 1.0.0
description: Greets the world!
----

IMPORTANT: Ensure that your `name` and `version` matches the `name` and `version` in your folder name, or you get an error.

Next, open up your `templates/template.yml` file.
Here, we are going to specify the actual information about your package and, most importantly, set default values.
In the `template.yml`, copy the template for the kind `SpringCloudDeployerApplication` from the preceding sample.
Your resulting `template.yml` file should resemble the following:

----
# templates/template.yml

apiVersion: skipper.spring.io/v1
kind: SpringCloudDeployerApplication
metadata:
  name: demo
spec:
  resource: maven://org.springframework.cloud.samples:spring-cloud-skipper-samples-helloworld
  version: {{version}}
  applicationProperties:
    {{#spec.applicationProperties.entrySet}}
    {{key}}: {{value}}
    {{/spec.applicationProperties.entrySet}}
  deploymentProperties:
    {{#spec.deploymentProperties.entrySet}}
    {{key}}: {{value}}
    {{/spec.deploymentProperties.entrySet}}
----

The preceding example file specifies that our application name is `demo` and finds our package in Maven.
Now we can specify the `version`, `applicationProperties`, and `deploymentProperties` in our `values.yml`, as follows:

----
# values.yml

# This is a YAML-formatted file.
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates
version: 1.0.0.RELEASE
spec:
  applicationProperties:
    server.port: 8100
----

The preceding example sets the `version` to `1.0.0.RELEASE` and also sets the `server.port=8100` as one of the application properties.
When the Skipper Package reader resolves these values by merging the `values.yml` against the template, the resolved values resemble the following:

----
# hypothetical template.yml

apiVersion: skipper.spring.io/v1
kind: SpringCloudDeployerApplication
metadata:
  name: demo
spec:
  resource: maven://org.springframework.cloud.samples:spring-cloud-skipper-samples-helloworld
  version: 1.0.0.RELEASE
  applicationProperties:
    server.port: 8100
  deploymentProperties:
----

The reason to use `values.yml` instead of entering the values directly is that it lets you overwrite the values at run time by using the `--file` or `--properties` flags.

We have finished making our file.
Now we have to zip it up.
The easiest way to do is by using the `zip -r` command on the command line, as follows:

----
$ zip -r demo-1.0.0.zip demo-1.0.0/
  adding: demo-1.0.0/ (stored 0%)
  adding: demo-1.0.0/package.yml (deflated 14%)
  adding: demo-1.0.0/templates/ (stored 0%)
  adding: demo-1.0.0/templates/template.yml (deflated 55%)
  adding: demo-1.0.0/values.yml (deflated 4%)
----

Armed with our zipped file and the path to it, we can head to Skipper and use the `upload` command, as follows:

----
skipper:>package upload --path /Users/path-to-your-zip/demo-1.0.0.zip
Package uploaded successfully:[demo:1.0.0]
----

Now you can search for it as shown previously and then install it, as follows

----
skipper:>package install --package-name demo --package-version 1.0.0 --release-name demo
Released demo. Now at version v1.
----

Congratulations! You have now created, packaged, uploaded, and installed your own Skipper package!

[[using-repositories]]
== Repositories

Repositories store package metadata and host package .zip files.
Repositores can be local or remote, were local means backed by Skipper's relational database and remote means a filesystem exposed over HTTP.

When registering a remote registry (for example, the `experimental` one that is currently not defined by default in addition to one named local`), use the following format:

----
spring
  cloud:
    skipper:
      server:
        package-repositories:
          -
            name: experimental
            url: https://skipper-repository.cfapps.io/repository/experimental
            description: Experimental Skipper Repository
            repoOrder: 0
          -
            name: local
            url: http://${spring.cloud.client.hostname}:7577
            local: true
            description: Default local database backed repository
            repoOrder: 1

----

IMPORTANT: When modifying default configuration you need to re-define everything under `spring.cloud.skipper.server.package-repositories`.

The `repoOrder` determines which repository serves up a package if one with the same name is registered in two or more repositories.

The directory structure assumed for a remote repository is the registered `url` value followed by the package name and then the zip file name (for example, `https://skipper-repository.cfapps.io/repository/experimental/helloworld/helloworld-1.0.0.zip` for the package `helloworld` with a version of `1.0.0`).
A file named `index.yml` is expected to be directly under the registered `url` -- for example, https://skipper-repository.cfapps.io/repository/experimental/index.yml.
This file contains the package metadata for all the packages hosted by the repository.

It is up to you to update the `index.yml` file "'by hand'" for remote repositories.

'Local' repositories are backed by Skipper's database.
In the Skipper 1.0 release, they do not expose the index.yml or the .zip files under a filesystem-like URL structure as with remote repositories.
This feature will be provided in the next version.
However, you can upload packages to a local repository and do not need to maintain an index file.
See the "`<<skipper-commands-reference>>`" section for information on creating local repositories.

A good example that shows using a Spring Boot web application with static resources to host a Repository can be found https://github.com/markpollack/skipper-sample-repository[here].
This application is currently running under https://skipper-repository.cfapps.io/repository/experimental.
