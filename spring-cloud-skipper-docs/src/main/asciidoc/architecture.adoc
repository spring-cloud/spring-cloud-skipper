Skipper is a basic client server architecture.
The server exposes a HTTP API that is used by the interactive shell.
The server persists Package Metadata and Release state in a relational database.

Platforms are defined using Spring Boot's https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html[Externalized Configuration] feature.  See the <<platforms>> section for more information on configuring the platfoms.
The platforms map onto an instance of a Spring Cloud Deployer implementation which is what is repsonsible for deploying the applications.

The release workflow is currently a hard-coded `blue/green` workflow.
The plan is to use the https://projects.spring.io/spring-statemachine/[Spring Cloud State Machine] project to orchestrate the release workflow.
