In this section you will learn all about the Spring Cloud Skipper REST API.

[[api-guide-overview]]
== Overview

Spring Cloud Skipper provides a  REST API allowing you to access all aspects of
the server. In fact the Spring Cloud Skipper Shell is a first-class consumer of
that API.

[[api-guide-overview-http-verbs]]
=== HTTP verbs

Spring Cloud Skipper tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and
REST conventions in its use of HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PUT`
| Used to update an existing resource, including partial updates. Also used for
resources that imply the concept of `restarts`.

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===

[[api-guide-overview-http-status-codes]]
=== HTTP status codes

RESTful note tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's `Location` header

| `204 No Content`
| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist

|===

[[api-guide-overview-headers]]

[[api-guide-overview-errors]]
=== Errors

include::{snippets}/api-documentation/errors/response-fields.adoc[]

[[api-guide-overview-hypermedia]]
=== Hypermedia

Spring Cloud Skipper uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources
in their responses. Responses are in http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application from resource to resource Language (HAL)] format. Links can be found beneath the `_links` key. Users of the API should not create URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described links to navigate.

[[api-guide-resources]]
== Resources

[[api-guide-resources-index]]
=== Index

The index provides the entry point into Spring Cloud Data Flow's REST API.
