This section covers the Spring Cloud Skipper REST API.
--

[[api-guide-overview]]
== Overview

Spring Cloud Skipper provides a  REST API that lets you access all aspects of the server.
The Spring Cloud Skipper shell is a first-class consumer of the API.

[[api-guide-overview-http-verbs]]
=== HTTP Verbs

Spring Cloud Skipper tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its use of HTTP verbs.
The following table shows each verb and how Skipper uses it:

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource.

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource.

| `PUT`
| Used to update an existing resource, including partial updates.
Also used for resources that imply the concept of `restarts`.

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource.
|===

[[api-guide-overview-http-status-codes]]
=== HTTP Status Codes

Skipper adheres as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its use of HTTP status codes.
The following table shows each status and its meaning in Skipper:

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully.

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully.
The resource's URI is available from the response's `Location` header.

| `204 No Content`
| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully.

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body includes an error that provides further information.

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource does not exist.

|===

[[api-guide-overview-headers]]
=== Headers

Every response has the following header(s):

include::{snippets}/api-documentation/headers/response-headers.adoc[]

[[api-guide-overview-errors]]
=== Errors

include::{snippets}/api-documentation/errors/response-fields.adoc[]

[[api-guide-overview-hypermedia]]
=== Hypermedia

Spring Cloud Skipper uses hypermedia.
As a result, resources include links to other resources in their responses.
More specifically, responses are in http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application from resource to resource Language (HAL)] format.
Links can be found beneath the `_links` key.
Consumers of the API should not create URIs themselves.
Instead they should use the links in the resources to navigate.

[[api-guide-resources]]
== Resources

[[api-guide-resources-index]]
=== Index

The index provides the entry point into Spring Cloud Skipper's REST API.

[[api-guide-resources-index-access]]
==== Accessing the Index

You can use a `GET` request to access the index.
