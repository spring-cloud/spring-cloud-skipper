= Getting Started

This section describes the minimal steps to install Skipper on your local machine in addition to using Skipper to installing a sample application.
It is the "`three-second tour`".
After completing this section, you can move on to the <<three-minute-tour>>.
When you are ready to dive deeper, head on over to the "`three-hour tour`" section, <<three-hour-tour>>.
(Well, it is not really three hours....)

[[getting-started-system-requirements]]
== System Requirements

The Skipper server is a Spring Boot application.
Both the server and the shell are based on Java 8.
The server uses an RDBMS to store state.
An embedded H2 database is used if you do not provide a Data Source configuration through Spring Boot configuration properties.
Supported databases are H2, HSQLDB, MySQL, Oracle, Postgresql, DB2, and SqlServer.
Schemas are created on server startup


[[getting-started-installing-skipper]]
== Installing Skipper

This section covers installing Skipper on your *local machine*, as it is the easiest way to get started.
The section <<skipper-installation>> discusses installing on Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes.
It also shows additional options for installing on your local machine.

* Download the Skipper server and shell apps by using the following commands in a terminal session:

[source,bash,subs=attributes]
```
wget http://repo.spring.io/{version-type-lowercase}/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-skipper-server/{project-version}/spring-cloud-skipper-server-{project-version}.jar

wget http://repo.spring.io/{version-type-lowercase}/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-skipper-shell/{project-version}/spring-cloud-skipper-shell-{project-version}.jar
```

* Launch the server and shell apps by using the following commands in a terminal session:

[source,bash,subs=attributes]
```
java -jar spring-cloud-skipper-server-{project-version}.jar


java -jar spring-cloud-skipper-shell-{project-version}.jar
```

The default port that the server listens on is 7577.  That is `SKPR` on a telephone keypad.  :)

There is also a docker image hosted on https://hub.docker.com/r/springcloud/spring-cloud-skipper-server/[dockerhub]

*Now install some apps!*


[[three-second-tour]]
== A Three-second Tour

The default configuration of Skipper deploys apps to the local machine.
The default configuration also has one local repository, named `local`, where you can upload packages, and one remote repository, named `experimental`, where some sample test packages are located.
You can get a list of the package repositories by using the command `repo list`, as shown (with its output) in the following example:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
skipper:>repo list
╔════════════╤═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╤═════╤═════╗
║    Name    │                            URL                            │Local│Order║

╚════════════╧═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╧═════╧═════╝

Search for the available packages using the `package search` command.
The following example shows the `package search` command and typical output for it:
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
skipper:>package search
╔═════════════════╤═══════╤════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║      Name       │Version│                                  Description                                   ║

Install the Maven-based Hello World application by using the `package install` command.
Since this application picks a random port for the HTTP server by default, we specify the Spring Boot property `server.port`, prefixed with `spec.applicationProperties`.
The prefix is due to the internal format of the <<package-templates,template file>>.
The following example shows the whole command with its output:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
skipper:>package install --release-name helloworld-local --package-name helloworld --package-version 1.0.0 --properties spec.applicationProperties.server.port=8099
Released helloworld-local. Now at version v1.
----
You can now curl the `greeting` endpoint, as follows:
```
$ curl http://localhost:8099/greeting
Hello World!
```

The release name, `helloworld-local`, is used for subsequent commands, such as `release status`, `release upgrade` or `release delete`.

To see the status of the release, use the `release status` command, as shown (with its output) in the following example:
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
skipper:>release status --release-name helloworld-local
╔═══════════════╤═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗

║Status         │DEPLOYED                                                                             ║
║Platform Status│All applications have been successfully deployed.                                    ║
║               │[helloworld-local.helloworld-v1], State = [helloworld-local.helloworld-v1-0=deployed]║
╚═══════════════╧═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
----
Now we can upgrade the release.
The `1.0.1` package refers to a newly released application that changed the default value of the greeting to be in `Portuguese`.
The following example shows a typical `release upgrade` command with its output:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
skipper:>release upgrade --release-name helloworld-local --package-name helloworld --package-version 1.0.1  --properties spec.applicationProperties.server.port=8100
helloworld-local has been upgraded.  Now at version v2.
----

The preceding example command deploys the new version of the application, waits until it is healthy, and then destroys the old version of the application.
You can then see the status of the application by using the `release status` command, as follows:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
skipper:>release status --release-name helloworld-local
╔═══════════════╤═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║Last Deployed  │Fri Oct 27 16:20:07 IST 2017                                                         ║
║Status         │DEPLOYED                                                                             ║
║Platform Status│All applications have been successfully deployed.                                    ║
║               │[helloworld-local.helloworld-v2], State = [helloworld-local.helloworld-v2-0=deployed]║
╚═══════════════╧═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
----

You can now curl the `greeting` endpoint at the new port and see that the application has been updated, as follows:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8100/greeting
Olá Mundo!
```

To delete the release, use the `delete` command, as shown (with its output) in the following example:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
skipper:>release delete --release-name helloworld-local
helloworld-local has been deleted.
----
NOTE: This example, where the upgrade changed only a property of the application, is not realistic.
A more realistic example is the case where code has changed so that the updated application behaves differently.

You can also deploy the other packages named `helloworld-docker` to the local machine.

The examples in this section have shown the most basic operations.
Other interesting commands such as `manifest get`, `release rollback`, `release list`, and `release history` are covered in the <<three-minute-tour>>.
