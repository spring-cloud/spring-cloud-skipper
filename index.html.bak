## Overview

A package manager that installs, upgrades, and rolls back applications on multiple Cloud Platforms.

Supported application types are Spring Boot applications and those defined by Cloud Foundry application manifests.
Supported Cloud Platforms are local, Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes.

Skipper can be used as part of implementing the practice of Continuous Deployment. It provides a
versioned "single source of truth" that defines what applications were deployed to the cloud. This
enables easy rollbacks and upgrades without having to rebuild applications from source code.
